# Image-Classification-Model

### Description

The image classification model is a deep learning model, which is used to identify the body type of the car and classify the images based on the visual features. A transfer learning method is employed for the development of this model. This is to show how we can use a pre-trained model to process the images and do the classification based on the features. In this deep learning project, the model used is EfficientNetB0. The accuracy can be improved by using regularizing technique. Also, we can try other pre-trained models to develop this classification model.
